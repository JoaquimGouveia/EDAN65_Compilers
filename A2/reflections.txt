Similarities: Hyfsat lika struktur och production rules (exp har exempelvis exakt samma regel), both have the same terminals (but the Abstract grammar has some extra)

Differences: The abstract grammar includes explicit AST node construction => Each production rule ends with some kind of  object creation.
The abstract grammar, as described in the assignment, 
also introduces new language features such as ask and user. There is also some kind of suffix (ex: .a and .b) after some tokens
