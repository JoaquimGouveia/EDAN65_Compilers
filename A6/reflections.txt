Exercise 3
Program 1:
Source code:
int main() {
    return 1;
}
Assembly code:
main:
    # Setup the stack frame
    pushq %rbp  # Save old base pointer (stack fram for main)
    movq %rsp, %rbp   # Set the new base pointer (current function's stack frame)

    # Function body of main
    movq $1, %rax # Place return value(1) in %rax

    # Teardown the stack frame
    movq %rbp, %rsp  # Restore stack pointer (teardown stack frame)
    popq %rbp  # Restore old base pointer

    # Exit the program using the system call for Exit
